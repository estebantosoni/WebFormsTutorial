## ⚠️ Notes

### 🛠️ Project Setup

In the first video, I **did not follow** Marie's instructions to create the project, since the interface has changed since then.  
This project was created using **Visual Studio 2022**.

For the setup, I used this video by **TutorPraveen**:  
🔗 [How to Create ASP.NET Web Forms using Visual Studio 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef6xWENJia4&t=1s)

After that, I followed Marie’s tutorial precisely.

### 🗄️ Database

Starting from **video 10**, you will need a database and a table named `Color`.

- I used **SQL Server Management Studio 20** along with **SQL Server Express 2022**.
- Remember to update the `connectionStrings` section in the `Web.config` file with your own credentials.

### 🎨 Styles

Some style classes (inside the `class` attribute in `.aspx` files) **do not work** because their definitions are not shown in the tutorials.  
However, this **does not prevent** you from following the videos and testing each section successfully.
